      "content": "# Strategic Position\nZeroAvia is positioning itself as the leader in hydrogen-electric powertrains for regional aircraft. Unlike competitors focusing on battery-electric, their bet is that hydrogen offers better range/weight ratio for 10-80 seat aircraft.\n\n## Key Milestones\n- 2020: First hydrogen fuel cell flight (6-seater)\n- 2023: 19-seater ground testing completed\n- Target 2025: Certification for commercial ops\n\n## Strategic Partnerships\nStrong relationship with **British Airways** (LOI for 10-50 aircraft) signals commercial viability pathway. Partnership with **Mitsubishi** provides access to Asian markets and manufacturing scale.\n\n## Technical Approach\nUsing PEM fuel cells (not alkaline) due to faster start-up times and better power density. Current challenge is hydrogen storage - testing both compressed (350 bar) and liquid options.\n\n## Regulatory Path\nWorking closely with CAA (UK) and EASA on certification. Major blocker: no existing certification standards for hydrogen powertrains in aviation. Pioneering the regulatory framework itself.\n\n## Risk Factors\n- Dependent on hydrogen infrastructure at airports (chicken-egg problem)\n- Competition from Airbus (Zeroe program) with deeper pockets\n- Certification timeline uncertain (3-5 year range)\n\n## Funding\nTotal funding: £45M\n- Public: £35M (primarily through ATI)\n- Private: £10M (Series C)",
